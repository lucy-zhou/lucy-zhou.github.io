The wheels are purchased and modified by the Formula SAE team. Formula cars need to be designed and built for speed around a corner on pavement.

Members of the team work on the gears in the back of the race car in preparation on Saturday, April 21, at Mohler Lab. Though the engine was purchased, Formula SAE modified the engine and built the carbon fiber components.

The Lehigh Formula SAE team works on the car for the test drive on Saturday, April 21, at Mohler Laboratory. The racecar designed and built by the team will be raced in the Society of Automotive Engineers competition, which encourages students to learn and apply engineering skills.

Formula SAE makes final touches on the car before the test drive the next day on Saturday, April 21, at Mohler Lab. The steel tubes were cut, notched and welded by the team.

## Infographic on Tourism in China
![Tourism in China Infographic](https://github.com/lucy-zhou/lucy-zhou.github.io/blob/master/Shanghai.png?raw=true)
Source: Travel China Guide. This infographic shows the growth rate of tourism in China from 2011-2016. The background image is a picture I took this past summer (Summer 2017) when I visited my parents in Shanghai. The negative growth rate can be attributed to the increase in costs of visiting China. The exchange rate has increased since around 2007 and people are less willing to spend money while traveling. The air pollution and health issues in the country could also cause a decline in tourism. Tourism in China is still huge though; as many as 100 million tourists visit throughout the year.
## Evolution of Flannels

This timeline is about the history and evolution of flannels. Though the fabric was invented by the Welsh and was first popular in Europe, the flannel eventually reached America. The production and sale of flannels in America led to the emergence of the grunge style and an increase in popularity. Today, flannel is mainstream and seen everywhere. I chose this topic because I own a lot of flannels and love the comfort and softness of the material. I was curious about how and where the fabric originated from because flannels are part of my everyday style.
## Chart of Statistics for New England Patriots Over 10 Years

This bar chart shows the different variables of wins and losses for the 16 games played by the New England Patriots every year for the past 10 years. The rank in yard differential and rank in point differential compares the Patriots with the 31 other teams in the NFL. I grew up in the New England area and have lived in Massachusetts for the majority of my life. My dad and brother were huge influences in introducing me to football and becoming such a big Patriots fan.

I was interested in researching how many people in the U.S. population spoke another language at home besides English. I speak both English and Chinese, so I wanted to know how many other people speak Chinese based on the state or area they live in. I also decided to choose Spanish and French because those languages are commonly taught in middle schools and high schools. I took French classes throughout middle school and high school, but I'm not fluent. It surprised me to find so many Chinese speakers in California and New York, but those two states seem more diverse in their resident population. I knew the most prevalent language would be Spanish, but in comparison with Chinese and French, Spanish speakers are significantly greater. I used data from the 2010 US Census for resident population in the United States and Puerto Rico. The data that included the number of Chinese, French and Spanish speakers was collected froom 2009-2013 for each state in the United States and Puerto Rico. Source: US Census Bureau.
