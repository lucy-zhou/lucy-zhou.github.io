## Infographic on Tourism in China
![Tourism in China Infographic](https://github.com/lucy-zhou/lucy-zhou.github.io/blob/master/Shanghai.png?raw=true)
Source: Travel China Guide. This infographic shows the growth rate of tourism in China from 2011-2016. The background image is a picture I took this past summer (Summer 2017) when I visited my parents in Shanghai. The negative growth rate can be attributed to the increase in costs of visiting China. The exchange rate has increased since around 2007 and people are less willing to spend money while traveling. The air pollution and health issues in the country could also cause a decline in tourism. Tourism in China is still huge though; as many as 100 million tourists visit throughout the year.

This timeline is about the history and evolution of flannels. Though the fabric was invented by the Welsh and was first popular in Europe, the flannel eventually reached America. The production and sale of flannels in America led to the emergence of the grunge style and an increase in popularity. Today, flannel is mainstream and seen everywhere. I chose this topic because I own a lot of flannels and love the comfort and softness of the material. I was curious about how and where the fabric originated from because flannels are part of my everyday style.
